# Resilient Anomaly Detection in Fiber-Optic Networks: A
Machine Learning Framework for Multi-Threat Identification
Using State-of-Polarization Monitoring

<p>
  We present a thorough machine-learning framework based on real-time state 1
of polarization (SOP) monitoring for robust anomaly identification in optical fiber net- 2
works. We exploit SOP data under three different threat scenarios: (i) malicious or critical 3
vibration events, (ii) overlapping mechanical disturbances, and (iii) malicious fiber tap- 4
ping (eavesdropping). We have used various supervised machine learning techniques like 5
k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and deci- 6
sion trees to classify different vibration events. We also assessed the framework’s resilience 7
to background interference by superimposing sinusoidal noise at different frequencies and 8
examining its effects on the polarization signatures. This analysis provides insight into 9
how subsurface installations, subject to ambient vibrations, affect detection fidelity. This 10
highlights the sensitivity to which external interference affects polarization fingerprints. 11
Crucially, it demonstrates the system’s capacity to discern and alert on malicious vibration 12
events even in the presence of environmental noise. However, we focus on the necessity 13
of noise-mitigation techniques in real-world implementations while providing a potent, 14
real-time mechanism for multi-threat recognition in the fiber networks.
